Forecast verification report `r format(verification.date,"03v-%Y%m%d")`

Issued `r format(verification.date,"%d-%m-%Y")`. 

Prepared by Mark R. Payne and Christian KiÃ¦r, DTU Aqua, Copenhagen, Denmark. 

This is the forecast verification report for the forecast of the `r forecast.cohort` cohort strength for North Sea sandeel stocks. The verification is based on the forecast sheet `r forecast.sheet`.

## Forecast As Issued
*The 2020 North Sea sandeel recruitment forecast covers two (1r, 2r) of the four assessed sandeel stocks in the North Sea, together with the combined recruitment across these two stocks. Forecasts for all individual stocks suggest a low probability of a strong year class, with a high probability  of these year classes being in the lower third of the historically observed recruitment (Figure 1). 

The portfolio forecast (for recruitment summed across stocks 1r and 2r) indicates a low probability of a strong overall year class. *

## Conclusions
There is good agreement between the forecast and assessed recruitment in Area 1r. The most likely values forecast for this stock agree well with the assessment results, which bracket the peak of the distribution. The  recruitment tercile was also predicted correctly.

The forecast for Area 2r performed less well: a "Low" recruitment was forecast, while a "Medium" recruitment was assessed. 

The portfolio forecast agrees well with the assessed recruitment, both in terms of the expected value and the tercile.
