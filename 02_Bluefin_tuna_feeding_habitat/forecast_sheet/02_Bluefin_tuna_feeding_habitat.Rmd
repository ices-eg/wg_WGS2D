## Forecast
All forecast models suggest the absence of suitable habitat for bluefin tuna in the Denmark strait region in August `r forecast.yr` (Figure 1): however, the models forecast expanded habitat around the Rekyjanes ridge area and in the central Norwegian sea when compared to the long-term mean. The total area of thermally suitable habitat in this region will be lower than the peaks seen in 2010 and 2012 (Figure 2), although the amount of habitat is expected to remain above that seen prior to the mid-1990s.

The contour line corresponding to a probability of 0.5, which has been used here to define the most likely limit of suitabe habitat, is plotted  as a heavy blue line, while the average habitat boundary (1983-2005) is plotted with a red line. All regions south and east of these lines are classified as suitable habitat.*"}

## Background

An exploratory fishing survey for Atlantic mackerel performed in August 2012 in Denmark strait between Iceland and Greenland 
captured three individual adult bluefin tuna (Thynnus thunnus) (MacKenzie et al. 2014). It is believed that this was the first such reported occurrence in this region in at least 370 years, and most likely ever. The tuna were captured in a single net-haul in 9-11º C water together with 6 tonnes of mackerel, which is a preferred prey species and itself a new immigrant to the area (Astthorsson et al., 2012). Regional temperatures in August 2012 were historically high and part of a warming trend since 1985, when temperatures began to rise. As a consequence, the area of relatively warm water (i. e., > 11 C) which could serve as potential habitat in this region has expanded by more than 800 000 km2, an area the size of France (Figure 2). The presence of bluefin tuna in this region is likely due to a combination of these warm temperatures that are physiologically more tolerable and immigration of an important prey species into the region.

A white star marks the location of the haul (65°420N, 30°500W) which captured three bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) using pelagic fishing gear during exploratory scientifically monitored fishing for mackerel (Scomber scombrus).

Tuna are unique amongst fish in that they have the ability to regulate their body temperature and maintain a body temperature above the ambient water temperature, analogous to the physiological of mammals (although less efficient). The dynamics of this process have been well studied using data storage tags e.g. (Block et al., 2001; Walli et al., 2009) and show that, while feeding bluefin tuna can make forays into extremely cold water (down to 0 deg C), both laterally across fronts and vertically into deep water, they always need water of around 11 deg C or  warmer to return to “warm-up” again, especially during the nighttime when they cannot feed. This strict physiological requirement for access to warm “refuge” water ultimately places a constraint on their distribution and mirrors the results derived by other authors  (Muhling et al., 2017a, 2017b). Furthermore, given that 1) the surface layers are typically the warmest part of the ocean 2) sea surface temperature (SST) is readily observed from satellite and 3) SST is the most predictable marine variable, this would seem to be well suited for prediction.

## Quality Considerations

An important point to make in the interpretation of these results is that the skill of these forecasts is inherently asymmetrical in nature. The presence of suitable thermal habitat in a region does not necessarily guarantee that it will be occupied by fish – other processes that are not encapsulated in this analysis, such as the presence of suitable prey, or even the abundance of bluefin tuna itself, can also be limiting, while the peculiarities of migration dynamics can also be important. On the other hand, the absence of suitable thermal habitat does guarantee the absence of fish – if the water is below their cold tolerance bluefin tuna will not enter, regardless of how much prey is present. In this way, our forecasts are essentially asymmetrical in nature – they are much better at predicting absence than presence – and should be interpreted with corresponding care.

Secondly, our yearly estimates of the suitable habitat area (Figure 2)  integrate the local spatial variability in temperature that bluefin tuna might detect and perceive when in and near the region.  The forecast  of the area of suitable habitat (Figure 2) should therefore always be considered in conjunction with the spatial forecast (Figure 1).

## Forecast Skill Assessment

Forecast skill was assessed using historical data independent of those used in model development, for different time lags. The NMME forecast system outperforms a persistence forecast at lead times beyond approximately three months (Figure 4). 
```{r Skill_assessment, fig.cap="**Figure 4. Skill assessment.** *The skill of the North America Multimodel Ensemble (NMME) in forecasting the area of suitable habitat in the Irminger Sea region as a function of leadtime is assessed. Model skill, represented as the correlation between the forecast and observed ara of habitat, is plotted as a function of lead time, in months after the forcast was initialised. Dotted thin lines correspond to the individual components of the NMME, while the heavy read line is the skill of the combined ensemble mean forecast. The persistence forcast (blue line) provides a baseline reference forecast by assuming the the observed anomalies will persist.*"}
