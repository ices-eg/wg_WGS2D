## Forecast
The spawning distribution for March `r forecast.yr` is expected to be highly compressed against the continental shelf edge, reflecting the continuing current unusual oceanographic conditions in the region. Minimal spawning on or to the west of Rockall Plateau is expected (Figure 1). In historical terms, the westward extent of spawning is forecast to be among the lowest since 1950 and the spawning area small (Figure 2).

## How to Use this Forecast

This forecast should be used as a broad-scale indicator of the expected spawning distribution of blue whiting in the upcoming spawning season. This forecast can be used in planning monitoring activities on this stock (e.g. the International Blue Whiting Spawning Stock Survey (IBWSSS)) and commercial fishing activities.

## Background

The spawning distribution of blue whiting has varied in the past and has expanded, contracted and shifted locations (Figures 2, 3). The dominant feature of these changes is a westward expansion away from the shelf-break region west of the European continental shelf onto the Rockall plateau and Hatton bank region (Figure 3).

![**Figure 3. Spatial distributions of blue whiting from the International Blue Whiting Spawning Stock Survey**. *Two years characterized by different oceanographic conditions (2007 and 2013) are shown. Note the large difference in range occupied towards the west in 2007 compared to 2013.*](resources/Expanded_contracted.png)

Shifts in the spawning distribution of blue whiting have been linked to oceanographic conditions in this region (Hatun et al. 2009) and, in particular, to salinity (Miesner and Payne 2018). Spawning typically occurs within a narrow salinity window between approximately 35.3 and 35.5 (Figure 4). Salinity in this region is strongly driven, in turn, by the dynamics of the North Atlantic Sub-polar Gyre (Hatun et al. 2005). The slow dynamics of oceanographic properties can be used to provide reliable estimates of future distributions of water masses and thereby spawning habitat for blue whiting. 

![**Figure 4. Relationship between spawning and salinity from independent data sources**. *Presence frequency of spawning blue whiting (number of pixels with presences) a) observed in scientific surveys and b) caught in fisheries is compared to the mean salinity (250-600 m) at which these observations were made (bars). The blue line indicates the modelled smooth function of blue whiting larval-presence obtained from the Species Distribution Model (SDM) based on larval blue whiting catches by the CPR survey, with dashed lines indicating the standard error. Panel a) shows salinity observations from late March / early April, and Panel b)  shows data from March.*](resources/Salinity_relationship.png)

Table: **Table 1. Overview of the basis for the forecast.**

This forecast is based on a species distribution model developed by Miesner and Payne (2018). The model uses observations of blue whiting larvae captured in the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) as a response variable and links their presence to environmental covariates as explanatory variables, including salinity at spawning depth (250-600m), latitude, day of year, solar elevation angle and bathymetry. Salinity at spawning depth was shown to be the most important environmental factor that varied inter-annually, and drives the westward expansion of spawning habitat. The model has been verified by cross-validation with the CPR observations. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the larval response to salinity obtained from CPR data shows good agreement with independent distribution data sets obtained from both commercial fishers and scientific surveys (Figure 4). 

Forecasts of the physical environment (and specifically salinity at spawning depth) are derived by assuming that the most recently observed state of the environment will persist until at least the next spawning period and possibly beyond. 

## Quality Considerations

This forecast is a prediction of the potential spawning habitat of the species and should not be interpreted as a direct forecast of distribution. While there is a relationship between the two, it is important to remember that the actual distribution of spawning may not utilise all of the potential spawning habitat (e.g. due to migration dynamics, density-dependent processes or other biotic factors). On the other hand, it is unlikely that spawning can occur in the absence of suitable habitat. The ability of this forecast to represent distribution is therefore asymmetrical.

The forecast is based on observations of larvae, and therefore reflects the distribution of spawning activity. However, pre- and post-spawning fish are also migrating to and from the spawning grounds during this time, and although they are not reflected in this forecast, they may be observed in both scientific surveys and commercial fisheries. The forecast skill is therefore strongest in the east-west direction (perpendicular to the axis of migration) and weaker in the north-south direction. 

Forecasts of the physical environment in this region are currently based on persistence i.e. the assumption that, for example, next year will be the same as this year. While the dynamics in this region are typically slow, they have occasionally moved rapidly, which could cause discrepancies between forecasted and observed spawning habitat. However, such events are considered relatively rare and analysis of the forecast skill has shown that this is a valid assumption.


## Forecast Skill Assessment

Forecast skill was assessed using historical data independent of those used in model development for different time lags. The skill based on persistence is significant for forecast lead-times up to 2-3 years (Figure 5). 

![**Figure 5. Forecast skill assessment**. *Forecast skill is shown for a) the  area (km²) and b) westward extent of potential spawning area for blue whiting in the waters west of the European continental shelf. The plots show correlation based on persistence of ocean dynamics for various lead times into the future. The dashed line indicates the minimum significant correlation (P > 0.05).*](resources/Skill.png)

### S1. 2018 Forecast Verification
A further indication of the performance of the forecast system can be gained by comparing the forecasts issued previously with the actual observations. We have compared the forecast issued in January 2018 with the corresponding distribution observed in the International Blue Whiting Spawning Stock (IBWSS) survey performed in March 2018 (Figure S1.1).  


```{r Performance,fig.cap="**Figure S1.1. 2018 forecast verification** *Comparison of forecast habitat and observed distribution for the 2018 spawning season. The forecast spawning habitat is reproduced from the January 2018 WGS2D forecast (Forecast sheet 001-v02.1) and is represented as coloured areas, corresponding to the probability of observing blue whiting larvae in a single haul performed by the Continuous Plankton Recorder. Acoustic density (sA values) observed in 2018 IBWSS survey are plotted as circles whose area is proportional to the sA value – crosses indicate absence of blue whiting. The 1000m and 2000m isobaths are added for reference.*"}

```

As can be see, there is good qualitative agreement between the habitat forecast with two months leadtime, and the observed distribution. As expected, the agreement is strongest in the east-west direction, and the forecast particularly reproduces the confinement of the spawning stock to the rockall trough region. Observations of fish in the Faroe-Scotland channel and around Shetland are most likely pre- or post-spawning fish migrating to or from the spawning grounds.

### S2. Oceanographic Conditions

To provide a more detailed insight into the current oceanographic conditions driving the distribution, the current state of salinity at the spawning depth is shown below, as of `r most.recent.data`. In particular, the well-reported salinity anomalies in the North Atlantic Sub-Polar Gyre (upper-left side of panel b) are having a clear effect on the spawning region of blue whiting and compressing the spawning habitat.

```{r Oceanography_map,fig.cap="**Figure S2.1 Observed salinity distribution and associated anomaly in the spawning region.** *Salinity is based on the EN4 observational dataset for November 2018 at spawning depth (250-600m) and is plotted as a) the absolute value and b) the deviation from the annual climatology (1960-2010).
