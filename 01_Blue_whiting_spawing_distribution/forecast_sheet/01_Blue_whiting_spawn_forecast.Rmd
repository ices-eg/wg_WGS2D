Forecast sheet `r format(issue.date,"01-%Y%m%d")`. Issued `r format(issue.date,"%d-%m-%Y")`, covering the March `r forecast.yr` spawning distribution.

Prepared by Mark R. Payne, DTU Aqua, Copenhagen, Denmark. 

This forecast sheet is the first forecast for the `r forecast.yr` blue whiting spawning season. An update of this forecast will be issued on or before 12 March 2021. For details, see the Change Log at the bottom of this document.

## Forecast
The spawning habitat for March `r forecast.yr` is expected to be compressed against the continental shelf edge. Minimal spawning on or to the west of Rockall Plateau is expected (Figure 1). In historical terms, the spawning habitat is forecast to be among the most contracted since 1950 (Figure 2).

## How to Use this Forecast

This forecast should be used as a broad-scale indicator of the expected spawning habitat of blue whiting in the upcoming spawning season. This forecast can be used in planning monitoring activities on this stock (e.g. the International Blue Whiting Spawning Stock Survey (IBWSSS)) and commercial fishing activities.

## Background

The spawning distribution of blue whiting can vary substantially from year to year (Figures 3). The dominant feature of these changes is a westward expansion away from the shelf-break region west of the European continental shelf onto the Rockall plateau and Hatton bank region.

![**Figure 3. Spatial distributions of blue whiting from the International Blue Whiting Spawning Stock Survey**. *Two years characterized by different oceanographic conditions (2007 and 2013) are shown. Note the large difference in range occupied towards the west in 2007 compared to 2013.*](resources/Expanded_contracted.png)

Shifts in the spawning distribution of blue whiting have been linked to oceanographic conditions in this region (Hatun et al. 2009) and, in particular, to salinity (Miesner and Payne 2018). Analysis of data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder spanning the period 1951-2005 using an ecological niche model (ENM)  has shown that larvae are primarily found within a narrow salinity window between approximately 35.3 and 35.5 (Figure 4). Retrospective predictions of habitat from the ENM (e.g. Figure 5) show good agreement with observations of adult distribution from scientific monitoring surveys (Figure 3).

Salinity in this region is strongly driven by the dynamics of the North Atlantic Sub-polar Gyre (Hatun et al. 2005). This large body of relatively cool, fresher water has significant dynamics of its own, but they tend to vary slowly from year to year. Near-real time observations of these  oceanographic properties can be used as   reliable estimates of water mass locations in the near-future and thereby the spawning habitat for blue whiting.

![**Figure 4. Relationship between spawning and salinity from independent data sources**. *Presence frequency of spawning blue whiting (number of pixels with presences) a) observed in scientific surveys and b) caught in fisheries is compared to the mean salinity (250-600 m) at which these observations were made (bars). The blue line indicates the modelled smooth function of blue whiting larval-presence obtained from the Species Distribution Model (SDM) based on larval blue whiting catches by the CPR survey, with dashed lines indicating the standard error. Panel a) shows salinity observations from late March / early April, and Panel b)  shows data from March.*](resources/Salinity_relationship.png)

Table: **Table 1. Overview of the basis for the forecast.**

This forecast is based on a species distribution model developed by Miesner and Payne (2018). The model uses observations of blue whiting larvae captured in the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) as a response variable and links their presence to environmental covariates as explanatory variables, including salinity at spawning depth (250-600m), latitude, day of year, solar elevation angle and bathymetry. Salinity at spawning depth was shown to be the most important environmental factor that varied inter-annually, and drives the westward expansion of spawning habitat. The model has been verified by cross-validation with the CPR observations. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the larval response to salinity obtained from CPR data shows good agreement with independent distribution data sets obtained from both commercial fishers and scientific surveys (Figure 4). 

Time-series of modelled habitats are generated based on the EN4 dataset from 1950 to the present day. These habitat maps are first cropped to cover the main spawning grounds of the "Northern" population of this species (Pointin and Payne 2013), as defined by the box with boundaries at 25W, 5W, 53N and 60N. The maps are then reduced to a time-series using Principle Components Analysis - the first princple component explains approximately 80% of the variance, while the associated Empirical Orthogonal Function reveals that this is strongly associated with an east-west mode of variability, and therefore the expansion or compression of the stock. Exploratory analyses have shown that this metric is strongly correlated with both the area of the spawning habitat and its westward extent. This first PC is used as the main indicator of the size of the habitat area (Figures 2,6).

Forecasts of the physical environment (and specifically salinity at spawning depth) are derived by assuming that the most recently observed state of the environment (anomaly) will persist until at least the next spawning period and possibly beyond. 


## Quality Considerations

This forecast is a prediction of the potential spawning habitat of the species and should not be interpreted as a direct forecast of distribution. While there is a relationship between the two, it is important to remember that the actual distribution of spawning may not utilise all of the potential spawning habitat (e.g. due to migration dynamics, density-dependent processes or other biotic factors). On the other hand, it is unlikely that spawning can occur in the absence of suitable habitat. The ability of this forecast to represent distribution is therefore asymmetrical.

The forecast is based on observations of larvae, and therefore reflects the distribution of spawning activity. However, pre- and post-spawning fish are also migrating to and from the spawning grounds during this time, and although they are not reflected in this forecast, they may be observed in both scientific surveys and commercial fisheries. The forecast skill is therefore strongest in the east-west direction (perpendicular to the axis of migration). 

Forecasts of the physical environment in this region are currently based on persistence i.e. the assumption that, for example, next year will be the same as this year. While the dynamics in this region are typically slow, they have occasionally moved rapidly, which could cause discrepancies between forecasted and observed spawning habitat. However, such events are considered relatively rare and analysis of the forecast skill has shown that this is a valid assumption.

## Forecast Skill Assessment

Forecast skill was assessed using historical data independent of those used in model development for different time lags. The skill based on persistence is significant for forecast lead-times up to 2-3 years (Figure 6). For the short-term, the correlation coefficient is greater than 0.75.
```{r Fig_skill,fig.cap="**Figure 6 Forecast skill assessment**. *Forecast skill is shown for metric of spawning habitat extent for the northern component of blue whiting in the waters west of the European continental shelf. The plots show correlation based on persistence of ocean dynamics for various lead times into the future. The dashed line indicates the minimum significant correlation (P > 0.05) for a one-tailed t-test (i.e. true correlation coefficient is greater than zero).*"}

<!-- As can be see, there is good qualitative agreement between the habitat forecast with two months leadtime, and the observed distribution. As expected, the agreement is strongest in the east-west direction, and the forecast particularly reproduces the confinement of the spawning stock to the rockall trough region. Observations of fish in the Faroe-Scotland channel and around Shetland are most likely pre- or post-spawning fish migrating to or from the spawning grounds. -->

### S1. Oceanographic Conditions

To provide a more detailed insight into the current oceanographic conditions driving the distribution, the current state of salinity at the spawning depth is shown below. In particular, the well-reported salinity anomalies in the North Atlantic Sub-Polar Gyre (upper-left side of panel b) are having a clear effect on the spawning region of blue whiting and compressing the spawning habitat.

```{r Oceanography_map,fig.cap="**Figure S2.1 Comparison of alternative salinity datasets.** *The most recent salinity estimates at spawning depth (250-600m) from two observationally-based analysis products (EN4, CORIOLIS) and two model-based ocean reanalyses (ARMORD3D, Mercator) are plotted. The while isohalines define the suitable salinity window (35.3 - 35.5). The 1000m and 2000m isobaths are added for reference. Panels are labelled with the name of the data product and the date of the most recent estimate. All datasources are interpolated onto a common 0.25 degree grid.*"}
